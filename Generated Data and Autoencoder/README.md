## Usage
This code isn't really meant to be usable, mostly because the dataset required to run it cannot be uploaded, so this is only for demonstrating purposes. The Jupyter notebook files are generally "results-type" files where I load data/results and show some stuff that is relevant in the plots. The actual "working" code that does most of the computations and data processing sits in the python files.

The script that runs the models in cross-validation is gen_data_model.py
